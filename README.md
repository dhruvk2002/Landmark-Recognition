# Landmark Detection App

This Streamlit app utilizes a pre-trained TensorFlow Hub model for detecting landmarks in Asia. The model is trained on the Google-Landmarks-v1 dataset.

## TensorFlow Hub Model

The landmark detection model is hosted on TensorFlow Hub. You can find the model [here](https://tfhub.dev/google/on_device_vision/classifier/landmarks_classifier_asia_V1/1).
